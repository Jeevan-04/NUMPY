## Introduction
NumPy provides several functions to save and load data in different formats. This lesson demonstrates how to use these functions effectively.

## Saving and Loading Text Files
### `np.savetxt`
Saves an array to a text file.

### `np.loadtxt`
Loads data from a text file.

## Saving and Loading Binary Files
### `np.save`
Saves an array to a binary file in NumPy `.npy` format.

### `np.load`
Loads data from a binary file in NumPy `.npy` format.

### `np.savez_compressed`
Saves multiple arrays to a compressed `.npz` file.

### `np.tofile`
Saves an array to a binary file.

### `np.fromfile`
Loads data from a binary file.

## Handling Missing Values
### `np.genfromtxt`
Loads data from a text file, handling missing values.

## Summary
This lesson covered various methods to read and write files using NumPy, including handling missing values and saving/loading data in both text and binary formats.

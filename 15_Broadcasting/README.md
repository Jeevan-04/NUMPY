## np.broadcast()
The `np.broadcast()` function returns an object that mimics broadcasting. It produces an iterator that yields pairs of elements from the input arrays.

## np.broadcast_arrays()
The `np.broadcast_arrays()` function broadcasts any number of arrays against each other.

## np.broadcast_to()
The `np.broadcast_to()` function broadcasts an array to a new shape.

## np.reshape()
The `np.reshape()` function gives a new shape to an array without changing its data. It supports broadcasting.

## np.newaxis
The `np.newaxis` is used to increase the dimensions of the existing array by one more dimension, when used once.

## np.expand_dims()
The `np.expand_dims()` function expands the shape of an array by inserting a new axis at the specified position.

## np.squeeze()
The `np.squeeze()` function removes single-dimensional entries from the shape of an array.
